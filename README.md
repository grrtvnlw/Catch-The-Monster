# Setup

First, you'll need to install the `pyglet` library so that `python3` can use it.

In a shell, please run the following command. It does not matter what directory you are in.

```sh
pip3 install pyglet
```

`pip3` is a program that comes with `python3` and it can download and install free python libraries from the Internet.

On your computer, the program might be called `pip` instead of `pip3`. If `pip3 install pyglet` gives you an error, try `pip install pyglet`.

# The game

To run the game, use the following command:

```sh
python3 app.py
```


# Explore

- Move the score text so it's not in the way ;)
- Change how fast our player can move
- Reduce the chance the monster will change direction to 20%
- Replace the monster's image with the `goblin.png`
- Play a different sound when you catch a monster

# Improve

## Small

- When the hero catches a monster, increase the score by 10
- When the score reaches 100, call the `game_over()` function
    - When the game is over, display a "You won" message and play the "win" sound effect
- Change the score label either using a different font or by using HTML: https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/text/index.html
- Download some (free!) graphics from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets?q=2d) and replace the hero and monster. (Cats, maybe??)

## Medium

- add a goblin to the game
    - use the `goblin.png` image in the `resources` folder
    - The goblin should try to catch the hero
        - If the goblin touches the hero, it takes one life
        - If the hero loses 3 lives, the game is over
            - Stop playing the music and play the 'lose' sound
    - Add a "lives" text display next to the score.

- Add a magical item at random to the screen:
    - Each magical item enhances our hero's abilities (or bestows new ones)
    - The 'bullet' increases the hero's speed temporarily
    - The 'flame' allows the hero to shoot goblins (thus taking them off screen)

## Large

- As the player's score increases, add more goblins

- Add an 'stone' the screen for saving the state of the game, including the score, number of lives, magical abilities, and position of each character on the screen.
    - It should only appear temporarily.
    - If the player loses all their lives, ask if they want to load their saved game.
        - Optionally, delete the saved game info so the player can only use a saved game once.
